defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ClassifierPornReferrerCounts do

  ReferrerCounts stores how many referrers an images has and how many of them were classified as porn and as adult/softporn respectively. Note that a referrer is usually a landing page, but as of March 2011 this also includes referrers which an image can 'inherit' by propagating counts from near duplicate images.

  ## Attributes

  *   `adult` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - 
  *   `porn` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of referrers which are classified as porn and as adult.
  *   `total` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Total number of referrers.
