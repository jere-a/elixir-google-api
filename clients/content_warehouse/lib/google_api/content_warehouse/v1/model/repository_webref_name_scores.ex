defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefNameScores do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents some name-specific scores. (Unlike EntityNameScore, these scores are independent of the entities the name is associated with). These scores are available for each name as well as for each name/source. Next available tag: 31.

  ## Attributes

  *   `completeWorldVolume` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Approximates volume of this name including entities we don't have in our set. This is useful to estimate the size of the "open world". For example, this field can be equal to the total number of clicks for the query. Note that for now, we ignore the number of clicks but just use the idf if available.
  *   `contextFringeScore` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The fringe score in [0, 1] for this context name. This is only populated for full-query context names.
  *   `contextWeight` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The amount of evidence available for this context name.
  *   `idfScore` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The idf of this name.
  *   `openWorldVolumeModifier` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - 'Raw' open world is computed based on ngram count data. For some names however, we modify the open world based on entities associated with them. This field contains the additive open world modifier. open_world_volume = raw open world + open_world_volume_modifier
  *   `totalScore` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The total score of that name/source. It describes how much data we have for that name/source. It can for example be the sum of all the entity scores for this name.
