  ## Attributes

  *   `supportsHotwordSensitivity` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the device supports different levels of hotword sensitivity. go/hotword-sensitivity-prd
  *   `supportsSimpleStop` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether Simple Stop (go/simple-stop) is enabled on the device. Simple stop allows users to stop firing alarms and timers by just saying "stop" without first saying the hotword.
  *   `supportsSpeakerId` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the device supports speaker-id (speaker identification based on hotword and/or spoken query - go/speaker-id). Note: there are existing devices that support speaker-id but does not have this capability set. Not having this field populated doesn't necessarily mean the device doesn't support speaker-id.
  *   `supportsWarmWords` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the device supports WarmWords (go/warm-words-framework).
