defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingEmbeddedContentOutputGenerationTimestamps do
  @moduledoc """
  For each of the output fields generated by the embedded content system, the Unix timestamp of when it was most recently generated. Used for controlling the frequency of generation (and thus exporting) of the fields which are expensive to generate and/or the consumers of which are not able to handle the high load of daily/hourly updates. If a timestamp corresponding to an output field is missing, it means the last attempt to generate this field failed (which could be mean that the document was not important enough for this field to be generated, or that we hit a bug in WebKit). In case we choose not to regenerate the field (because the latest generation timestamp is too fresh) the corresponding timestamp doesn't change. Next tag available: 8
