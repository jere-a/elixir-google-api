defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialGraphApiProtoPartialNameOptionsNamePartSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies how each piece of the name should be handled. Names are structured into given name and family name and this allows an independent specification for each of these pieces. Very limited preprocessing is done for this option (leading whitespace trimming mostly). Composed names are treated as a single unit and are not broken down.

  ## Attributes

  *   `hideAll` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Completely omit that part of the name.
  *   `showAll` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Show the complete name. Note that this does not express the same semantics as show_first_n_chars=length_of_name, because when regenerating a shortened name the new name could have more characters, thus yielding a different result.
  *   `showFirstNChars` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Show first `n` characters. Same note about characters referring to "grapheme_clusters" applies.
  *   `showInitial` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Show only the initial, i.e., a single character. Note that "character" refers to "user-perceived" characters, aka a "grapheme cluster". See go/morphology for more details.
  *   `truncationIndicator` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Which truncation indicator to use after the shortened piece of the name. Will be ignored for the `hide_all` or `show_all` options.
