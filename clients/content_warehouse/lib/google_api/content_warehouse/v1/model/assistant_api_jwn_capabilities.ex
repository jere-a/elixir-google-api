  These capabilities are used to determine the jwn libraries and their versions that are present on the client.

  ## Attributes

  *   `librariesVersionMap` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The name and version of the jwn libraries currently stored on the client. These are the same that the server communicated when the library was first sent down.
  *   `supportedCompressionMode` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Compression algorithms supported on the client. Server can choose one of these to compress WhatsNext Javascript programs and libraries.
  *   `supportsJwn` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the client supports running jwn code.
