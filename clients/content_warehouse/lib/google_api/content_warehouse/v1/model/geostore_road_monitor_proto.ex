  A road monitor is a device that observes traffic for road violations like speeding or running a red light. These are modeled within MapFacts so that navigation services can warn users when they drive along road segments that are monitored.

  ## Attributes

  *   `monitoredRoad` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The TYPE_ROAD segment features that this road monitor may observe.
