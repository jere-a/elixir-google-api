  Used when a field is accessible to a legacy contact group. Contact groups are discouraged and may be deprecated soon. ContactGroupAcls are read-only. If they are included as part of an ACL on an Update, an exception is thrown.

  ## Attributes

  *   `contactGroupId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A contact group ID. This is either a user-defined contact group hex ID, or it is the string name of the enum constant in Group.PredefinedId in FBS backend.proto for predefined groups. Common values for the predefined name include, but are not limited to: all, myContacts, starred, chatBuddies, friends, family, coworkers, and blocked.
  *   `displayName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The localized display name for the predefined group, if known; or, the display name for the user-defined contact group. Included when FieldAclOption.FULL_ACL_WITH_DETAILS is requested.
