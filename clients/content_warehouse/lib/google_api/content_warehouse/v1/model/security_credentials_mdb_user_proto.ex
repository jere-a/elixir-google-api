  An entity from the MDB namespace that is to be interpreted as a user. If using this for authorization, you should only do an exact match on the peer role against user_name.

  ## Attributes

  *   `gaiaId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Do not set this field. Contact credentials-eng@ if you believe you absolutely need to use it. This is the @prod.google.com Gaia ID that corresponds to the MDB user, see go/authn-merge for details. This field may always be safely ignored when performing an authorization check.
  *   `userName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) -
