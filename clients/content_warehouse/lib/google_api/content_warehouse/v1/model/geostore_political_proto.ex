defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostorePoliticalProto do

  This protocol buffer is included from feature.proto as an optional message. Political features represent the different ways that people are divided into geographical regions. This protocol buffer is applicable only to TYPE_POLITICAL features and is used to store political information from the feature's point of view.

  ## Attributes

  *   `capital` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Many political regions have a conceptual center (capitals of a country or a top-level division are examples). If set, the target feature must be a TYPE_LOCALITY feature.
  *   `claim` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Feature IDs of the features claimed by this feature's government that are not necessarily included in the feature's geometry.
  *   `grossDomesticProductUsdMillions` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The Gross Domestic Product of the political region measured in millions of current United States dollars. It must not be negative.
  *   `literacyPercent` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Percentage of population that are literate within a political region. It must be between 0 and 100.
  *   `population` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of people in this political region. This field is intended to store accurate population, not an estimation such as representative value for population range. It must not be negative.
