defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryOnDeviceAnnotationSignals do
  @moduledoc """
  Signals coming from on-device annotators.

  ## Attributes

  *   `provenance` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Provenance of the annotator. Equivalent to the `provenance` field in OnDeviceParserInput::AnnotationInfo. This is used to map from AnnotationInfo to nlp_sage.ScoredAnnotation, since nlp_sage.ScoredAnnotation doesn't have a native `provenance` field. Note in the (very) long term, we'd like to replace ScoredAnnotation with Argument altogether.
