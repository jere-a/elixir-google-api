defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostorePriceListNameInfoProto do
  @moduledoc """
  A PriceListNameInfoProto is used by PriceListProto and fields and messages contained in it for storing names, descriptions, languages, and IDs. The name field and the description field must be in the same language, as specified by the language field. None of the fields in this proto is required, although it is not expected to have the language field set unless there is a name or description. When the language field is not set, it is understood to be the preferred language of the locale where the establishment is located. An empty string for any of the fields is not allowed (as enforced by lints).

  ## Attributes

  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - 
  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - IDs are intended to be unique identifiers of PriceInfoLists, Sections, and Menu items. This is enforced by the ID_DUPLICATE_PRICE_LIST_ID lint.
  *   `language` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The external form of a Google International Identifiers Initiative (III) LanguageCode object. See google3/i18n/identifiers/languagecode.h for details. We place extra restrictions on languages in addition to what the III library requires. See go/geo-schema-reference/feature-properties/languages.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) -
