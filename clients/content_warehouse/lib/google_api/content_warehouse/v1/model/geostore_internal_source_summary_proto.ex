  ## Attributes

  *   `dataset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Within the above provider, the dataset from which this piece of data was generated. For fields that are auto-generated the "dataset" is likely to be some algorithm's or program's name. Similar to SourceInfoProto.dataset but with the difference that it is required to always be set. Providers that don't have a concept of dataset may use "default".
  *   `provider` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The data provider from which this piece of data was generated. Equivalent to SourceInfoProto.provider in the public schema.
