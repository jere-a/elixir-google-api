defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingDatetimeHoliday do
  @moduledoc """
  List of holidays that are not fixed absolute or relative dates on the Gregorian calendar.

  ## Attributes

  *   `nonFixed` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - There are 3 types of holidays supported by the datetime subgrammar: 1) NonFixedHolidayEnum: e.g., "easter", "chinese new year". 2) FetchedRelativeDateTime: e.g., "Thanksgiving" => [4th Thursday of November] 3) HolidayByMonthDay: e.g., "xmas" => [December 25] Each holiday of the first type is resolved by a C++ function; the 2nd and 3rd type of holidays are mapped to AbsoluteDateTime and FetchedRelativeDateTime, respectively, in grammar and are not needed to be represented in proto.
