defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto do
  @moduledoc """
  WARNING: Outside of FeatureProto, please avoid in favor of a standard civil time type. Direct usage is error-prone due to the conflation of physical time and civil time (go/httat). In a protocol buffer, please use google.type.Date, with an additional google.type.TimeOfDay for precision finer-grained than a day. (For google.type.DateTime, go/prototime#types cites go/httat#zoned_datetime as a caveat). In a programming language, see go/time-devguide/languages. Additionally in C++, google3/geostore/base/public/datetime.h has conversion functions between DateTimeProto and Abseil's civil time types.

  ## Attributes

  *   `precision` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This attribute describes the precision of the date and time. It would be unusual for a data provider to provide a precision along with their date. It is more likely that the precision of a date will be inferred from the date format. For example "19th century" is likely to be correct to the century, while "1800" is probably correct to the year. The precision should be semantically interpreted as a cast, so a DateTimeProto object with a seconds value corresponding to 2018-03-28 18:40:00 UTC and a precision of MONTH should be interpreted as "March 2018". The enums above are only some of the possible precision levels for dates and times. Clients may wish to add more precision enums in the future. However, these enums must be ordered by decreasing duration. Clients should be able to write date formatting code that looks like this: if (datetime.precision() <= DateTimeProto::PRECISION_CENTURY) { date = FormatCenturyDate(proto.seconds()); } else if (proto.precision() <= case DateTimeProto::PRECISION_DECADE) { date = FormatDecadeDate(proto.seconds()); } else { ... } See geostore/base/public/datetime.h for date formatting utility functions.
  *   `seconds` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of seconds since (or before) the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970). This is also the standard epoch for Java and Python time representations. If it is important for this time be displayed correctly for different time zones, convert the time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
