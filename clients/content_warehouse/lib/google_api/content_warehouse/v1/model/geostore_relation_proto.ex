defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRelationProto do
  @moduledoc """
  This message is embedded within a FeatureProto, and represents a geographic or logical relationship of that feature to some other feature. Note that some relation types are there purely for the purpose of grouping together other relation types. They are noted as ABSTRACT in comments. Other relation types are no longer supported / in use. They are noted as DEPRECATED in comments (and marked with the standard deprecated option, too). Other relation types are reserved for future use or just not intended for use at all, for various internal reasons. They are noted as RESERVED in comments. WARNING: Updates to this proto within a FeatureProto's related_feature field handled by standalone pipelines and are NOT atomic with regard to updates to the features being referenced; we do not guarantee that a given MapFacts snapshot will be consistent between this field and the related features.

  ## Attributes

  *   `metadata` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFieldMetadataProto.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Field-level metadata for this relation.
  *   `otherFeatureCountryCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If and only if the other feature is of TYPE_COUNTRY, the 2-letter country code. This is the FLAG_COUNTRY_CODE_2 name of the country component.
  *   `otherFeatureId` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The feature ID of the feature to which we're relating. WARNING: the related feature does not necessarily have a bound that encloses this feature, so in a bucketing MapReduce, you may not be able to follow all relationships. Relations that use strong references are annotated above but you can also refer to IsRelationStrong() in geostore/base/public/relation.h.
  *   `otherFeatureName` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreNameProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - RESERVED
  *   `otherFeatureTerritorialAdministrator` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If and only if the other feature is of TYPE_DISPUTED_AREA, the territorial administrator found in its GeopoliticalAttachmentProto.administered_by field, if any. Since this string is copied exactly, it may be a 2-letter country code or another type of descriptive string.
  *   `otherFeatureType` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The type of the feature to which we're relating.
  *   `overlapFraction` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - ** DEPRECATED ** If relation is exactly RELATION_OVERLAPS but not any of its subcategories, overlap_fraction contains an estimate of the fraction of the geometry of this feature that intersects with the other feature, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Note that this is a rough estimate based on cell coverings, and may not be very accurate. In particular, values of 0.0 and 1.0 are possible, even though in principle they should not be.
  *   `relation` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The relationship of the feature that contains this RelationProto to the feature other_feature_id. Note the relation_is_reversed field below. Some relations imply weak references, other strong ones. Strong references are annotated above but you can also refer to IsRelationStrong() in geostore/base/public/relation.h.
  *   `relationIsReversed` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - RESERVED
  *   `temporaryData` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.Proto2BridgeMessageSet.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A place for clients to attach arbitrary data to a relation. Never set in MapFacts.
