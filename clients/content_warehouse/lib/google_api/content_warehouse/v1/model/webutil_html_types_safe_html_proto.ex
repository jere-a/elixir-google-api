defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.WebutilHtmlTypesSafeHtmlProto do
  @moduledoc """
  IMPORTANT: It is unsafe to accept this message from an untrusted source, since it's trivial for an attacker to forge serialized messages that don't fulfill the type's safety contract -- for example, it could contain attacker controlled script. A system which receives a SafeHtmlProto implicitly trusts the producer of the SafeHtmlProto. So, it's generally safe to return this message in RPC responses, but generally unsafe to accept it in RPC requests.

  ## Attributes

  *   `privateDoNotAccessOrElseSafeHtmlWrappedValue` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - IMPORTANT: Never set or read this field, even from tests, it is private. See documentation at the top of .proto file for programming language packages with which to create or read this message.
