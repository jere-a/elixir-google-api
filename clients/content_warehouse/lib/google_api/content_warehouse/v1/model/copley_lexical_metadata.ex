defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.CopleyLexicalMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Contains lexical metadata for a given reference. For example, this proto will be used to store locale-specific Lexical mids for contact relationships (e.g. /g/11gv0vypg4 is the mid for mother in english and /g/11gmy_gv87 is for mother in french) as an extension to QRefAnnotation::other_metadata, when available.

  ## Attributes

  *   `canonicalLexicalMid` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Mid for an entity that has lexical data (a LexiconEntry). See https://g3doc.corp.google.com/nlp/generation/g3doc/lexical_data.md for for more information about lexical data. This is the canonical mid for this entity (eg. it would be for "mother" in EN even if user referred to "mom").
