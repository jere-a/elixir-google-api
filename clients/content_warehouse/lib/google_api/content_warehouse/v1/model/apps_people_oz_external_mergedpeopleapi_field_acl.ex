defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AppsPeopleOzExternalMergedpeopleapiFieldAcl do
  @moduledoc """
  The field ACL. Currently only populated on profile fields for the profile owner. A Person field ACL; see http://go/peopleapi-acl

  ## Attributes

  *   `aclEntry` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AppsPeopleOzExternalMergedpeopleapiFieldAclAclEntry.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A custom type of field ACL entry. The set of all ACL entries includes those listed in acl_entry as well as predefined_acl_entry.
  *   `authorizedViewers` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Set of users that will be authorized to view the field by this field ACL. If the ACL is public, this will only contain ALL_USERS. This field is synthesized, read-only, and currently only used for profile photos. It's populated under "person.photo.metadata.field_acl" for the current photo ACL and "person.photo.metadata.acl_choices" for available photo ACL choices. Note: The set of authorized viewers for a given FieldAcl may depend on the user's account type and domain configuration. For example, a PRIVATE_READ FieldAcl could have any of the following authorized viewers: Consumer user: [IDENTITY_ACL_ESTABLISHED] Dasher user without domain contact sharing: [IDENTITY_ACL_ESTABLISHED] Unicorn user: [SAME_UNICORN_FAMILY] Hafez user: []
  *   `predefinedAclEntry` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A common type of field ACL entry. A predefined ACL entry is a shortcut for a commonly occurring case of role and scope. For example, PUBLIC_READ is the same as an AclEntry with role = READER and scope.all_users = true. The set of all ACL entries includes those listed in acl_entry as well as predefined_acl_entry.
