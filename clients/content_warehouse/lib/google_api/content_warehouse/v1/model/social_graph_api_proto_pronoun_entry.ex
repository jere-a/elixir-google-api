  ## Attributes

  *   `languageCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Locale option in which the pronouns were set, in the BCP-47 format. Set by the client at write time.
  *   `pronounType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The pronoun entry type that the user has selected. This indicates which locale-independent classification of pronoun was selected (or optionally, if it is a custom field).
  *   `value` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The user's preferred pronouns. Eg. "they / them". This is a human-readable string to be displayed as the user's pronoun. Set at write-time, regardless of pronoun-type. Value is returned as it was set (no localization).
