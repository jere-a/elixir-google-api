  Viewability related dates.

  ## Attributes

  *   `effectiveDate` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, the LocaleViewability will become effective on this date. This field is used to allow pre-indexing of future books which will become viewable and searchable according to the LocaleViewability on the specified date. Before the effective date, the volume will have scanless-like VIEW_METADATA viewability. For details, see the design document at http://go/oceanviewabilityeffectivedate. The date is expressed as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
