  Encapsulates ramp-specific properties.

  ## Attributes

  *   `maxConnectedPriority` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The highest priority of any TYPE_ROAD endpoint segment which is transitively connected to this ramp via other ramp segments. For instance, if we have two roads connected through a series of ramps (omitting intersections): Road(P=96)-> Ramp 1 -> Ramp 2 -> Ramp 3 -> Road(P=122) -> Road(P=144) The `max_connected_priority` of all three intermediary ramps is 122. It's not 144, since Road(P=144) is connected through another road, not a ramp. This differs from the usual `SegmentProto.priority` field, which contains the lowest priority across any connected road segment.
