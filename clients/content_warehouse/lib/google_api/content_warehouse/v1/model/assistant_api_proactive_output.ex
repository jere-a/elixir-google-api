  ## Attributes

  *   `allowAllPersonalData` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Allows displaying all personal data on proactive surfaces with no face match capability.
  *   `androidTvAssistantSettingsSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - For ANDROID_TV devices, the location that this setting was last changed from. Note: this structure allows to extend to more per-vertical bits in the future.
  *   `healthAndFitnessProactive` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Allows displaying Health and Fitness content on proactive surfaces. This is a sub bit of the device-wide PR bit - the device-wide PR bit must be enabled AND this vertical sub bit must be enabled for H&F content to be shown. This bit will be available on all surfaces that have the proactive-bit enabled. If the proactive-bit is not enabled, then we do not show health and fitness content at all (or even allow access to this setting).
  *   `photosProactive` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Allows displaying photos content on Dragonglass proactive surfaces. This is a sub bit of the device-wide PR bit - the device-wide PR bit must be enabled AND this vertical sub bit must be enabled for photos content to be shown on Dragonglass surfaces. This bit will be available on all Dragonglass surfaces that have the proactive-bit enabled. If the proactive-bit is not enabled or it's not a Dragonglass surface, then we do not show proactive photos content at all, nor allow access to this setting. See go/opa-photos-sg-settings for more details.
  *   `userMatchProactive` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Settings for displaying personal data on proactive surfaces with face match capability.
