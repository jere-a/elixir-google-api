  Signals associated with NimbleAnnotator annotations.

  ## Attributes

  *   `annotationSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Where the annotation has been read from.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A client-controlled identifier that the client can use to distinguish between different sets of annotations.
  *   `version` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Version identifier used to isolate different clients from each other. A client should intersect this list of versions with the ones the client is interested in, and use the annotation if the intersection is non-empty.
