defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsSquareProto do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the set of members (of a given type) in a Google+ Square (see http://go/squares). A Square with default member_type is currently (1/2012) identical to the GaiaGroup with the same ID, but that is expected to change soon (see http://go/superglue). Support for this principal type is currently (1/2012) incomplete -- e.g., Keystore does not support it yet (see b/5703421).

  ## Attributes

  *   `memberType` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The type of Square members to consider, e.g. "all members" vs. "owners" vs. "admins". These are defined by legacy_relation_id values in social.graph.storage.EdgeTypeEnum.EdgeType enum options in social/graph/storage/proto/id.proto. See square.pb (defined in production/config/cdd/socialgraph/mixer_config/prod/node_type_config) for all valid edge types associated with square. Currently required.
  *   `squareId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Currently required.
