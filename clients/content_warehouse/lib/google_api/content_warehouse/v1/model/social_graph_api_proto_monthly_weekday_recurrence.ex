defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialGraphApiProtoMonthlyWeekdayRecurrence do
  @moduledoc """
  Pattern for a MONTHLY recurrence. This Monthly reccurence supports: 1. The nth specific weekday of the month. For example, the 3rd Wednesday of the month. This represents the 3rd instance of a Wednesday of the month, regardless of what weekday the month started on. It does not necessarily mean the Wednesday on the 3rd week of the month. Used in PeopleAPI layers + FBS/ContactsService (not in ProfileService)

  ## Attributes

  *   `weekDay` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The nth occurrence of week_day to match. I.e. For 3rd Wednesday of the month, week_day = WEDNESDAY and week_day_number = 3. Values beyond the end of the month are skipped.
  *   `weekDayNumber` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) -
