defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreLocaleProto do
  @moduledoc """
  A locale is a meta-feature that describes the geographic extent of localization preferences such as the local language, and formatting conventions for numbers, dates and monetary values. Multilingual areas may be contained by multiple locales. We try to model locales fine-grained enough for deciding which languages are typically used within a city. For example, while French is an official language for all of Switzerland, we would prefer to have Zurich contained by a separate (more fine-grained) Swiss-German locale indicating that German, not French, is the predominantly spoken language in this city. Note that language borders are frequently considered a political question and often don't have clearly defined extents. For example, California has a significant Spanish-speaking population, but Spanish is not an official language of California.

  ## Attributes

  *   `language` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreLocaleLanguageProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - This holds the list of languages spoken within a locale.
  *   `localizationPolicyId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the localization policy (from googledata/geostore/localization/localization_policies.textpb) to apply to features that have this locale as their best match locale. Localization policy IDs are arbitrary identifiers that uniquely distinguish a set of language-selection rules.
